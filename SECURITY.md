## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, we would like to know about it so we can take steps to address it as quickly as possible. We request that you **do not publicize the vulnerability before giving us a chance to address it**.

### How to Report

To report a security vulnerability, please send an email to [community@webcrumbs.org](mailto:community@webcrumbs.org). The email should include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps for reproducing the vulnerability, if applicable
- Your name (optional), or anonymous if you prefer

We don’t currently have a bounty program in place, but we deeply appreciate every report. Responsible disclosures help keep the whole community safe — thank you for looking out for everyone!
