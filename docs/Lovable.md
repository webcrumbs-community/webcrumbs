# Lovable Tutorial

## Add Webcrumbs Plugin to Lovable

1. Open your project in [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev/)
2. Ask AI to add the plugin where you want it to appear, e.g.:
   ```md
   Add this embed code before the hero section:
   <webcrumbs-plugin uri="https://plugins.webcrumbs.dev/demo-component/"></webcrumbs-plugin>
   <script src="https://cdn.webcrumbs.dev/@latest"></script>
   ```
   > _Replace `demo-component` with your plugin name published through [app.webcrumbs.ai](https://app.webcrumbs.ai) or with your own uri if self-hosted._
3. When you're ready, click **Publish**
