   <webcrumbs-plugin uri="https://plugins.webcrumbs.dev/demo-component/"></webcrumbs-plugin>
   <script src="https://cdn.webcrumbs.dev/@latest"></script>
   ```
   > _Replace `demo-component` with your plugin name published through [app.webcrumbs.ai](https://app.webcrumbs.ai) or with your own uri if self-hosted._
